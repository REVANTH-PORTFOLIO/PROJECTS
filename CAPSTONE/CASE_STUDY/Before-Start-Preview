Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

Introduction: 
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I worked for a fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. 
In order to answer the business questions, by following the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. 

Scenario:
A bike-share company in chicago wants to design a new marketing statergy to convert casual riders into annual members by understanding 
how casual riders and annual members use cyclists bike differently.
Finally, generated results from these recommendations must be backed up with compelling data insights  and professional data visualizations 
in order to approved by cyclistic executives.
